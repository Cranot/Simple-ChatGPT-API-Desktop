# Simple ChatGPT API Desktop with Magic Prompts ‚ú®
This is a simple app to run ChatGPT on desktop with your api, it also has magic prompts.

## How to use
Download ![v0.5](https://github.com/Cranot/Simple-ChatGPT-API-Desktop/raw/main/files/Windows-v0.5.zip)
1) You can either download a ready compiled version from "files" folder, or you can compile it your self. (requirements .Net-4.7.2)
2) Write your API and your Prompt.
3) Now you can hit "Generate" or "Magic"

## Features
### New: Token + $ Calculator
You get to see how much you spent for your requests
### New: 15 Predefined Commands *(You can easily add your own)
Summarize - Find Bugs - Explain - Analyze - Find Key Points - Paraphrase - Evaluate - Compare and Contrast - Predict - Connect - Critique - Interpret - Categorize - Question - Visualize

### Send Prompt
Will send the prompt as normal, you cant chat back to it.

### Magic Button ‚ú®
This will generate 10 prompt options generated on a ListBox.
You can select any suggested prompt from the list and then just click "Run this" to execute the new prompt on the original text,

## Limitations
* Tokens usage is based on my coding structure, you can always optimise and apply your own prompt structure.
* You cant chat back yet
* You need your own OpenAI key and Windows .Net4.7.2minimum (I usually work .net7 but i did that for more compatibility)
* The app is not robust for every scenario its expiremental, so it may crash, especially magic buttons ‚ú®
* The curl commands are not complex, if you want more options you can edit code to add more parameters.

## Upcoming v0.6+
- I'll try to add some experimental no limit parsing ‚àû
- Add some system prompts + auto role generator ‚ú®
- More checks, option to store your API key, along with pricing costs, with a reset button*
